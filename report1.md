I download the VSCODE, which is my IDE in the class, and I will use this app to wirting my code in the future.

**Step 2**

I remotely connecting in my VSCODE, which I can I can type in my password to log in my account, and then see my Cluster status in the computer.

**Step 3**

I try running the commands cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp a few times in different ways, both on your computer, and on the remote computer after ssh-ing.

**Step 4**

On my computer, getProperty returns windows 11 and my username, while on the server, it prints linux and my username for ieng6. This shows that the getProperty method returns the information of the system of which it runs on. It took 0 seconds at 19.4kb/s for the scp command.

After making my SSH key, it made the scp process a lot more efficient, especially since the original password was 12 characters long and sometimes I would mistype since I couldnâ€™t see it. 

**Step 6**

I write a command in quotes at the end of an ssh command to directly run it on the remote server. I use semicolons to run multiple commands on the same line in most terminals.
